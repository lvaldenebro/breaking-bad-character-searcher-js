# Project's title: Breaking Bad, dead or alive?

## Description

Welcome to the Breaking Bad character searcher, in which you can review the status of your favorite characters.

## Technologies

This web page was made using HTML5, SaSS, React, JS, localStorage, API REST, propTypes, React Router DOM and the React Starter Kit, that uses NodeJS, Gulp and JSON.

Please, take into account that all HTML, SaSS and React file are divided into components. Both SaSS and React files are named the same so it is easy to maintain and more ordered. All of them have descriptive names according to the place of the page they are developing or working on.

NOTE: as the API used for this web pages is no longer free, the code is commented but it is alive thanks to a json with the characters data.

## How to Use the Project

At the beginning of the page, you have the title and the searcher in which you can insert the name of the character to see its status. This page is working with only the 20 first characters of the JSON.

You can select one of them and it will appear into the left, in the favorites sections. If you want to remove it, you can either click on it into the Characters section or into the cross in favorites section. The favorite characters are also underlined with blue color.

And as the localStorage is active, you will never lose the data you have searched for.
